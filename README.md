# Solving 2D Poisson's eqn using PINNs

Project 3 of FYS-STK4155 (Anvendt dataanalyse og maskinl√¶ring) course at UiO 2023/2024

- `model.py`: A python script containing the base class for all neural network-based models used in this
report.
- `plot_utilities.py`: A convenience python script containing functions used for plotting.
- `results_lagaris_ex5.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook demonstrating the solution of Poisson problem (eq. 15)
using Lagaris, Likas, and Fotiadis (1998) method as described in section 2.2. Produces Figures 1 and
C.1.
- `results_iterative.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook demonstrating the solution of Poisson problem (eq. 20)
using Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel iteration methods, as described in sections 2.1 and 3.1. Produces Figures
2 and 3 and Table D.0.
- `results_lagaris.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook demonstrating the solution of Poisson problem (eq. 20)
using Lagaris, Likas, and Fotiadis (1998) method, as described in sections 2.2 and 3.2. Produces
Figures 4, 5, 6 and C.2.
